# TouchWorld_2023
Code Library of 'Touch-Interface World'.
Welcome to my project repository!

Please read AI-Assisted Programming Usage Statement.txt first!

This project's prototype includes nine Python scripts and one Arduino program.
DevelopmentProcessData.zip contains data I used and generated during the development process.
Due to GitHub's file upload limit (no more than 100 files), I packaged the DevelopmentProcessData folder. Sorry for any trouble!

Thank you for taking time to look over this project!
